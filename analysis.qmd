## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1

2 + 2

3 + 3

4 + 4

5 + 5

6 + 6

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). I made a mistace. 

## Olympic Sports I've Watched

-   Cycling
-   Basketball
-   Track and Field

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

storms |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = pressure, y = wind)) +
  geom_point()


```
